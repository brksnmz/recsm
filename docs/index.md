This course is about building strong quantitative social science foundations, so new AI technologies become an asset, not a black box.

This book accompanies the short course *RECSM: Quantitative Methods in Social Research*. It extends the slide decks with worked examples, code, and practice exercises that use the **European Social Survey (ESS)** microdata for the United Kingdom (GB), Germany (DE), and France (FR). 

**How to use this book**

- Each chapter mirrors a teaching day: descriptive statistics (Day 1), understanding associations (Day 2), nonlinear models and interactions (Day 3).
- Every exercise includes tidy, commented R code using the bundled `ess.csv` file and its HTML codebook (`ESS...subset codebook.html`).
- Required R packages are listed at the start of each chapter; install once and re-use.
